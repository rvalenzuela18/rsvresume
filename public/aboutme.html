            <h3>Guitar and Bass Playing</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: -15px;">One of my passions is playing both bass guitar and acoustic guitar, with a particular love for performing songs from the OPM (Original Pilipino Music) industry. I find immense joy in covering tracks by iconic bands such as Parokya ni Edgar, Rivermaya, and Eraserheads, as their music holds a special place in my heart and allows me to express myself creatively through rhythm and melody.

            <h3>Guitar and Bass Playing</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: -15px;">Another cherished hobby of mine is watching Netflix with my family, where we bond over our favorite shows that portray themes of love, passion, and friendship. Some of my top picks include 'How I Met Your Mother,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' and 'House MD,' as these series not only entertain but also inspire with their heartfelt narratives and meaningful relationships.
